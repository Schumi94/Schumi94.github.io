I started working on a Twitter bot that automatically retweet and likes tweets
of my favorite users. The whole project still is in an early alpha state and will be shown
later this year after it enters the beta state.

The main goal of the bot is, besides the simple functions of retweeting and liking
tweets of users, to automatically write commands under them which sounds like a real user.
The whole project works will run without any form of machine learning for the moment. It is possible
that I will build machine learning model into the bot for a better way of commenting under tweets.
